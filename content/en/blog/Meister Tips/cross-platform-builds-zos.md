## OpenMake Meister Supports z/OS Compiles for Cross Platform Builds.

OpenMake Meister for z/OS is the only build automation solution available that allows you to build and manage binaries, across the enterprise - from Windows and Unix to the [mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer), providing a cross platform build solution. Meister for z/OS provides a central, common build management method for managing your binaries, regardless of the language or Operating System.

So go ahead, develop on the mainframe. We have you covered.

### Key Benefits:

**Build Management Best Practices**

Meister for z/OS Build Services enable build management best practices by defining standard procedures for calling z/OS compilers.  Build Services are based on REXX and can be developed using the Meister for z/OS rich library of reusable REXX modules that perform common tasks such as generating JCL. Meister enable build best practices and enforces standard procedures in every build you execute.

**Adaptable and Dynamic Builds**

OpenMake Meister for z/OS is the perfect solution for developers writing applications that connect diverse platforms.  When your application spans both the legacy mainframe environment as well as the distributed environment, you need a method for building the application as if it runs on a single platform. Meister standardizes and centralizes the creation of binaries for both the mainframe and distributed platforms.

**On-demand Build Knowledge**

Meister for z/OS integrates into the Meister community-developed knowledge base, enabling cross-platform build coordination.  The community-developed knowledge base keeps all developers in sync providing a shared build object repository, common locations for reporting on parameter usage, and environment variable usage.  Build logs, reports and schedules are centralized, providing the self-service and self-documented build management support needed in today's lean development environments.

**Managing Source to Load Parity**

Meister for z/OS provides the deep dependency discovery needed for exposing the artifacts used to create your load objects.  Even when components are not stored in a version control tool, Meister for z/OS will provide the precise location of all source, objects and libraries, and where they were found when creating the binary.  When an application failure occurs, you need to trace the source of the offending event, similar to using fingerprints and DNA to track down the suspect of a crime.  With Meister for z/OS's advanced dependency discovery and reporting, every item used to create the binary is stored in an application "footprint" and reported in the application "Build Audit Report" regardless of versioning tool usage.
