<h1>Pre-Commit Builds with Meister</h1>
<p class="t2Text2" style="MARGIN: 0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><i>Pre-commit</i> builds are for 
building newly engineered changes and validating that code integration, unit 
testing and the build itself are successful before committing those code changes 
to a shared repository. <i>Pre-commit</i> builds prevent situations where an 
isolated code change breaks the team, continuous or nightly build.  
Breaking the central build delays schedules by impeding code releases to the 
testing and production environments.  Broken builds can cause projects to 
come to a halt until the build is addressed, and corrected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><i>Pre-commit</i> builds give the 
software engineer more responsibility and control over changes submitted to a 
project, while delivering higher overall quality. A project whose changes are 
submitted by multiple developers using sound <i>Pre-commit</i> builds will have 
improved on-time delivery to test and production environments. This is because 
there will be less chance that someone has introduced a change that breaks a 
standard validation test such as a unit test or at worst, the build itself.</p>
<p class="t2Text2" style="MARGIN: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The build is a critical part of the 
<i>Pre-commit</i> validation process, but other validation checks can be done. A 
<i>Pre-commit</i> workflow can include a build and other test and validation 
checks. Some systems, such as Perl and other scripting systems, do not require a 
separate build step, but can still benefit from <i>Pre-commit</i> validation 
checks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Meister allows you to execute your 
<i>Pre-commit</i> workflow from within your Eclipse, Microsoft Visual Studio, or 
other IDE. The workflow execution is actually independent of the IDE and runs 
externally using the <i>omsubmit</i> program. This provides you with the 
advantages of executing the same workflow inside or outside of the IDE. For 
builds, this means that you are no longer locked into an IDE build and can 
execute the same build, <i>Pre-commit</i>, that is executed for the team project 
build.</p>
