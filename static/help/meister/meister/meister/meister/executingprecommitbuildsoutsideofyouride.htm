<h2>Executing Pre-commit Builds Outside of Your IDE</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Meister makes it 
easy to execute your IDE <i>Project</i> build inside of your IDE, and to execute 
a full build outside of your IDE's control.  Meister's IDE integration 
(Eclipse Plug-in and Microsoft Visual Studio Add-in) monitors changes occurring 
inside the IDE that may impact the build itself.  This means that changes 
such as refactoring, adding libraries, adding source modules or any modification 
that requires a change to the build scripts themselves are tracked and monitored 
by Meister from inside the IDE.  Meister then synchronizes those changes 
with the <i>Pre-commit</i> or continuous build running outside of the IDE.  
Within the IDE you can execute either an IDE build, or a Meister 
<i>Pre-commit</i> build.  When the Meister <i>Pre-commit</i> build executes 
it calls a Meister Workflow, which you define, to regenerate the build scripts 
and to execute a full build of the entire application, not just your single 
<i>Project</i>.  You can configure your Workflow to perform pre and post 
build activities such as executing tests and deploying objects.  This 
allows you to execute a private "continuous integration" build before you commit 
your changes to the source repository.</p>
