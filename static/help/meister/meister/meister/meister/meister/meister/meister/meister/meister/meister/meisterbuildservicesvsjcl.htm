<h2>Meister Build Services  Vs.  JCL</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Regardless of your development process, the need for 
managing standardized JCL remains the same. Controlling and standardizing your 
Development, Test and Production compile JCL is critical if you strive to have 
an efficiently managed process for moving load modules to production. Meister 
for z/OS eliminates the tedious tasks of writing, reviewing and maintaining 
compile JCL.  Meister for z/OS uses the OpenMake Dynamic DevOps Suite 
Knowledgebase of information that contains the "know how" to generate 
standardized compile JCL for the different types of load modules needed for your 
runtime environment. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">In its simplest form, Meister for z/OS can generate 
JCL for each individual load module.  On a larger scale, Meister for z/OS 
can accurately re-build, incrementally or completely, large systems.  This 
ability is extremely critical in the process of creating the final production 
runtime libraries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Meister for z/OS's basic concepts come from the use 
of standardized compile JCL procedures.  Meister for z/OS is different from 
its competition in that most of the commonly used JCL procedures come "shrink 
wrapped" with the Meister for z/OS product.  These JCL procedures are 
referred to as Build Services, Build Rules and Build Methods. </p>
