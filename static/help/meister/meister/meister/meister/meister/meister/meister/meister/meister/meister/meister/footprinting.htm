<h3>Footprinting</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Footprinting or Bill of Material Reporting provides a list of 
dependencies that were included in the creation of the final deployable 
object.  Footprinting builds the information inside of the actual load 
module. Using the <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier">omident</span> program 
allows you to view the information about how the load module was created. This 
information includes all the environment variable settings of the machine where 
the compile was executed.  For those installations that do not want the 
Footprinting information included in the load module, a report is created during 
the build. This report can then be managed and released with the load 
module.  It can also be viewed in production should a problem occur that 
requires debugging down to the source code and dependency level.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These particular features of Meister for z/OS can take your 
build process beyond a static manual JCL coding effort, and instead can make it 
a powerful tool in your overall development effort.  </p>
