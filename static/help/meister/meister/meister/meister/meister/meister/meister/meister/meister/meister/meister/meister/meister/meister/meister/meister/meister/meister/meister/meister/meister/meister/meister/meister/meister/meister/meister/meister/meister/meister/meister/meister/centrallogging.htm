<h3>Central Logging</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">The Knowledgebase Server manages all Public and 
Private Build logs submitted for z/OS builds.  Users with the correct read 
privileges can view Public <i>Workflow</i> logs even if they did not execute the 
<i>Workflow</i>. A Private <i>Workflow</i> Log can only be viewed by the 
original creator. The Public <i>Workflow</i> Logs are stored on the 
Knowledgebase Server until they are deleted or archived.   The 
Knowledgebase Server manages private <i>Workflow</i> Logs based on date, 
specifically <i>Workflow</i> Logs created "Today", "Yesterday", "&lt;Day of 
Current Week&gt;", "1 Week", "2 Weeks", "1-3 Months", and "More Than 3 Months". 
This organization minimizes the amount of administration necessary to clean up 
Logs that are no longer needed.  <i>Workflow</i> can also be saved and 
checked into a Configuration Management tool for permanent record keeping. 
<i>Workflow</i> Logs are stored in XML format and can be viewed via any browser 
tool.  All <i>Workflow</i> Logs are written to the Knowledgebase 
Server.</p>
