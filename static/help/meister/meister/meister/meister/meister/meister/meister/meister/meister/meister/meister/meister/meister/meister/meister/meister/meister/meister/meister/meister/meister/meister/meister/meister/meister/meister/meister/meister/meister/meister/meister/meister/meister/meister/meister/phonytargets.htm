<p class="MsoHeader"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">Phony Targets are <i>Targets</i> 
that do not represent a "runnable" binary object such as an executable or 
library. Phony Targets instead are placeholders for performing specific actions 
such as copying files from one directory to the next.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">To create Phony Targets, first a 
<i>Build Service </i>for the Phony Target needs to be defined.  The 
<i>Build Service </i>must have specific<i> Build Rules</i> and <i>Build 
Methods</i> associated to the <i>Build Service </i>that performs the logic 
needed to create the Phony Target.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">Typically the Phony Target <i>Build 
Service </i>has a rule that defines the Final Target as <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">.noext</span> (no extension).  The 
dependency file extensions to the <i>Build Rule </i>should list all of the 
extensions that the <i>Build Method</i> will expect when performing the 
action.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">In order for the build to 
understand a Phony Target, a <i>Final Target</i> must be assigned to the 
<i>Build Service</i>, through a <i>Build Rule.</i>  This <i>Final 
Target</i> is most typically a 0 byte file that is created in the build 
directory as a result of the build. The <i>Final Target</i> is Phony simply 
because it is not the end result desired from the execution of the <i>Build 
Method</i>, but instead a placeholder that indicates the actions of the Phony 
Target were completed successfully.  Because of the need to have a Final 
Target result, when developing a customized <i>Build Method</i> for Phony 
Targets, the creation of a Final Target is required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">In some cases, the Phony Target 
does not need to be created every time a build is completed.  For example, 
if you are using a Phony Target to copy files to a shared execution area, you 
may only want this Phony Target step executed in certain cases.  To prevent 
Phony Targets from being created with every full build, select the checkbox 
"exclude from full build" found on the <i>Target Overview</i> 
Screen.   This will prevent the Phony Target from being created when 
the full build is executed.  To build the Phony Target, you must go to the 
Setup Build screen and "check" the Phony Target independently.  </p>
