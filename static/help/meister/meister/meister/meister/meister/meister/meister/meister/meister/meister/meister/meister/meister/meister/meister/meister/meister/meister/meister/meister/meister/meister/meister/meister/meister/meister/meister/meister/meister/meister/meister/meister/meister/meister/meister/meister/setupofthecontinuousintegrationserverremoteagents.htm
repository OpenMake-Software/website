<h2>Setup of the Continuous Integration Server Remote Agents</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Each local installation of Meister 
provides you with a local <i>Remote Agent,</i> referred to as “My 
Computer.”  You can use your local <i>Remote Agent</i> to execute your 
<i>Continuous Integration</i> process if your local machine is also your defined 
<i>Continuous Integration Server</i>. Your defined <i>Continuous Integration 
Server </i>is the machine that triggers your <i>Continuous Integration</i> 
process and is most commonly the machine that hosts your Source Code Management 
tool. This means that to use your <i>Continuous Integration</i> process on “My 
Computer”, your local machine should also be where you are managing your Source 
Code and where your <i>Continuous Integration</i> trigger will execute.  
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">In most installations, your 
<i>Continuous Integration</i> process will not run on your local machine and 
will instead run on a team shared machine.  For this reason, you will need 
to install onto your defined <i>Continuous Integration Server</i>, which is the 
machine that hosts your Source Code Management tool, an OpenMake <i>Remote 
Agent</i>.  To obtain a <i>Remote Agent</i> license, contact your OpenMake 
Software Account Representative or contact OpenMake Software directly for a 
<i>Remote Agent</i> License key.  If you have installed your OpenMake 
Knowledgebase on the same machine that hosts your Source Code Management tool, 
you can then use your OpenMake Knowledgebase Server as a <i>Remote 
Agent</i>.  In this case, you simply need to obtain a new Knowledgebase 
server license file, install it onto your Knowledgebase Server and re-start your 
Knowledgebase Server.  Alternatively, you can install a full <i>Remote 
Agent</i> on your machine that hosts your Source Code Management tool. </p>
