<h3>Distributing the Workload of the Workflow across multiple Server Pools</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><i></i> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><i>Workflow</i> execution times can 
be improved by leveraging the power of multiple machines.  A 
<i>Workflow</i> can be configured so that individual <i>Workflow Activities 
</i>in the <i>Workflow</i> can execute across different <i>Server Pools</i>. 
When the <i>Workflow</i> is run, the Knowledge Base server will queue 
<i>Workflow Activities</i> on a <i>Remote Agent</i> within the <i>Server 
Pool</i>, and query each <i>Remote Age</i>nt to find out how much CPU is being 
used. If a <i>Remote Agent</i> in the <i>Server Poo</i>l has reached its 
<i>Queue Threshold</i>, the Knowledge Base server will look for another 
<i>Remote Agent</i> in the Pool to offload <i>Workflow Activities</i>. If 
another <i>Remote Agent</i> in the <i>Server Pool </i>is running, and has not 
reached its <i>Queue Threshold</i> or its <i>Max Workflow </i>threshold, the 
Knowledge Base server will start queuing activities on that <i>Remote 
Agent</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">With <i>Server Pools</i>, you can 
execute <i>Workflow Activities</i> across multiple operating systems. All 
<i>Workflow Activities</i> can be distributed across multiple <i>Server 
Pools</i> in this way.  In a distributed <i>Workflow</i> each <i>Workflow 
Activity</i> is assigned to a particular <i>Server Pool</i>. The Knowledge Base 
server will determine based on a formula, which <i>Remote Agent</i> in the 
<i>Server Poo</i>l will be assigned each <i>Workflow Activity</i>.  When 
the <i>Workflow</i> executes, the <i>Workflow Activities </i>are distributed out 
to <i>Remote Agents</i> according to a formula, which is based on the number of 
<i>Workflow Activities</i> that can be queued on each <i>Remote Agent</i>, how 
many simultaneous <i>Workflows</i> can be run, and the CPU % Threshold. 
Controlling distributed <i>Workflows</i> by assigning individual <i>Workflow 
Activities</i> to <i>Server Pools </i>allows you the ability to ensure that the 
<i>Workflow Activities</i> is executed on a <i>Remote Agent</i> that is 
configured to properly execute the task.  For example, you cannot execute a 
Java compile on a machine that has only been configured to support .Net 
development. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
