<h2>Parallel Builds <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"></span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The term “Parallel” often refers to 
the ability to run multiple versions of a software <i>Build </i>simultaneously 
to support different stages of the software lifecycle, i.e., "dev," "test," 
"prod" and "emergency."  This is different than executing a Build in 
Parallelized mode whereby the compile process is being executed in a 
multi-threaded condition.  Parallel <i>Builds</i> allow you to repeat 
different versions of the <i>Build </i>across the lifecycle all at the same 
time. OpenMake Mojo does not control the <i>Build </i>scripts that execute your 
<i>Builds</i>.  Mojo simply executes the <i>Build</i> script that it was 
given.  If the <i>Build</i> scripts are not written to support the 
execution of different versions of the <i>Build</i>, then Mojo cannot 
automatically adjust the scripts to run in a Parallel way.  Workflows can 
be configured to execute separate versions of the <i>Build</i>, but it is not 
handled for you in an automatic way.   </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">However, OpenMake Meister fully 
supports the execution of different versions of a <i>Build</i> running at the 
same time<i>.</i> This is handled by passing a new list of <i>Dependency 
Directories</i> to the Meister <i>Build</i>.  Because Meister can 
re-generate your <i>Build</i> scripts automatically, it is easy for it to handle 
building different versions of the software build at the same time.  In 
addition, OpenMake Meister allows you to control who has access to execute the 
<i>Builds</i> and <i>Workflows</i> at the different stages through <i>Users</i> 
and <i>Groups</i>. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
