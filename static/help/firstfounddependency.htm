<h3>First Found Dependency</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When assigning your<i> Dependency Directory</i> to your 
<i>Project</i>, it is important to remember that you are providing the compiler 
with a list of where to find your source code and libraries.  Source code 
can live in many different directories. In an unmanaged build environment, 
finding the source code can be the largest effort in getting control over the 
build process. Files found using the <i>Dependency Directory</i> list are done 
on a first found basis.   This means that if you have several 
Directories defined to a <i>Project</i>, a search will be initiated during build 
time, beginning at the first Directory defined and ending at the last.  As 
soon as the source or library file is found, the search will stop – so the 
"first found" source or library by the same name will be used from the first 
directory from which it is found.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">*Note:  Unnecessary directories in the Dependency 
Directory will slow down the build process. </p>
