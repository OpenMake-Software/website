<h3>Ordering Dependency Directories</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">Once you have located your source 
code directories and have added them to your <i>Dependency Directory</i> List 
for your <i>Project</i>, it is important to specify the order in which you want 
these directories to be searched. <i> Dependency Directories</i> are used 
to find source code and pass the source code to compilers and linkers.  
Once the source code in the <i>Dependency Directory</i> is found, the search 
through the <i>Dependency Directory</i> is stopped.  Thus, it is important 
to carefully order the directories within a <i>Dependency Directory</i> 
according to what level of code is to be built.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">Order your directories by selecting 
the directory in the <i>Overview </i>screen of the <i>Project</i> from the 
<i>Project Explorer.</i> Use the <i>Up</i> and <i>Down</i> buttons to position 
the directory in the correct order.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">For example, if you are using a 
Life Cycle model and you manage your releases based on Development, QA and 
Production, you can build a <i>Dependency Directory</i> that looks first in 
Development, then in Test, then in Production.  If you are creating a 
<i>Dependency Directory</i> for a Test build, your <i>Dependency Directory</i> 
order should not include any references to the Development level of code.  
Using this methodology allows you to keep a full copy of your self-authored code 
at the Production level <i>Dependency Directory</i>, and keep only the changes 
in the Development and Test <i>Dependency Directories</i>.</p>
