<h2>Management Control Console Navigation</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The Management Control Console 
navigation menu allows you to configure “MyWorkflows”, monitor and administer 
“Server Pools” and view “Reports.” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The Management Control Console 
allows you to define <i>Server Pools</i>, execute <i>Workflows,</i> view 
<i>Workflow</i> results, view and download published Binaries, and run 
Administrative reports such as Build Service Configuration Summaries, User 
Administration Reports and Meister Insight Reports.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="C1HBullet" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">In 
addition, the “Home” page of the Management Control Console provides you a high 
level view of your overall <i>Workflow </i>results.  You are presented with 
four (4) different graphs that provide you information about the <i>Workflow</i> 
with the longest run, shortest run, highest errors and highest frequency.  
These Graphs show universal data on <i>Workflows</i> which means that the 
<i>Workflows</i> that are displayed in these graphs may be <i>Workflows</i> in 
which you do not have access.   </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><b>Top 5 
Longest Average Run Times:</b>  This graph shows you <i>Workflows </i>that 
are taking the longest to execute.  This information could provide you key 
data into problem areas that should be addressed.  For example, if a 
<i>Workflow</i> begins showing up in your top 5 “Longest Average Run Times” that 
in the past was not displayed, something may have changed that needs to be 
corrected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><b></b> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><b>Top 5 
Shortest Average Run Times:  </b>This graph presents the <i>Workflow</i> 
with the shortest run times.  These <i>Workflows</i> are often contain 
simple steps, building small applications, or are <i>Workflow</i>s that are 
optimized using OpenMake Meister’s parallelization or Build Avoidance 
features.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><b>Top 5 
Highest Average Error Rates</b>:  This graph displays <i>Workflows</i> that 
have the most errors per run.  This shows <i>Workflows</i> that have high 
errors in the build steps as well as in the steps that call to external 
Application Lifecycle Management tools.  If you are using OpenMake Meister 
to manage the calls to the compilers, each time a compiler/linker throws and 
error, Meister will capture and report on that particular error. If you are 
using a Make, Maven or Ant script, and the script ends with errors, only one 
error will be reported back from the build script.  For example, if you 
execute a Meister build and there are 10 compile errors, this graph will report 
10 errors.  If you are executing an external script that returns an error, 
only one error will be reported.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><b>Top 5 Most 
Frequently Executed <i>Workflows</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This Graph 
shows you the <i>Workflows</i> that are executed most frequently.  This can 
show when an application team is having difficulties with delivering a release, 
or simply show teams that are using agile practices with frequent build 
cycles.     </p>
